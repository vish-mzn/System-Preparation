# Java & System Design Preparation Guide 🧠💻

Welcome to my comprehensive preparation repository focused on mastering **Java**, **System Design**, **Software Engineering Principles**,
**Design Patterns**, and much more. This guide will serve as my study companion as I prepare for interviews and strengthen my core 
software engineering skills.

## 📌 Objectives

- Master Java programming with in-depth understanding of core concepts.
- Learn and apply System Design principles with real-world examples.
- Understand and implement SOLID principles, design patterns, and best practices.
- Prepare for technical interviews with structured notes, examples, and code.
- Keep track of daily progress and revision checkpoints.
